### Binary Search Tree Practice Project
- For students attending 131 SI sessions.

* Provided is a very minimal implementation of a binary search tree that has some skeleton functions to be completed.

* You are to complete the following functions
    * BinarySearchTree() ---- constructor
    * getMinimum()       ---- returns the minimum value in the tree
    * getMaximum()       ---- returns the maximum value in the tree
    * preorderPrint()    ---- prints the tree using a preorder traversal
    * inorderPrint()     ---- prints the tree using an inorder traversal
    * postorderPrint()   ---- prints the tree using a postorder traversal
